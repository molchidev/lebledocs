### **2. The Economy: Doro**
- **Doro** fuels every interaction in *Lebled*:
  - Bribe your way past obstacles.
  - Pay fines for your "mistakes."
  - Purchase items, privileges, and access to expansions.
- Earn Doro by:
  - Completing tasks.
  - Participating in events.
  - Selling in-game assets.
- Players can purchase Doro using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, creating a real-world economic tie-in.

### **3. Institutions and Corruption**
- Players will encounter numerous institutions, each with its own bizarre rules and systems.

- Quests tied to institutions will challenge your wit, patience, and resourcefulness.

### **4. Progression and Rewards**

## **Future Plans**

### **1. Hubs and Social Spaces**

- Regularly introduce new institutions, challenges, and events to keep the gameplay fresh.
- Add seasonal events and limited-time rewards to engage the player base.
